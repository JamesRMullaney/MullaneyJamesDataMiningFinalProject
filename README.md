### Proposal

The idea is to use online data to find correlations in what stats lead what teams to win in this yearâ€™s march madness and use it to predict the future matches.

**EDIT: Since March Madness ended, I will be using NBA Stats and prediciting the outcome for the rest of the season.**

### Initial Data Collection

Stats gotten from: [NBA's Official Website](NBA.com)

Process:
  - NBA.com has access to every boxscore for every game in table format
  - Copy / paste into excel ( I tried to find a webmining way to do it and couldn't . . . but really if it's as easy as copy / paste I'm using it!)
  - Removed some unneccesary columns
  - Copy / paste team statistics into excel
  - Removed unneccesary columns
  - Adjusted team names ( New York Knicks -> NYK )

### Data Manipulation

 - Adjust dataset to show 'W' as 1 and 'L' as 0
```python
stats['res'] = np.where(stats['res'] == 'W', 1, 0)
```
 - change datatypes to float64 for regression, besides team of course
```python
for col in stats:
    if stats[col].dtype != 'object':
        stats[col] = stats[col].astype('float64')
```
