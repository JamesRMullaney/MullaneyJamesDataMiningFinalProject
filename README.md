### Proposal

The idea is to use online data to find correlations in what stats lead what teams to win in this yearâ€™s march madness and use it to predict the future matches.

**EDIT: Since March Madness ended, I will be using NBA Stats and prediciting the outcome for the rest of the season.**

### Initial Data Collection

Stats gotten from: https://www.basketball-reference.com

Process:
  - Sorted teams by alphabetical order, to keep teams in same order over multiple .csv files
  - Converted offensive and defensive stats ( per 100 possessions ) to .csv files and added them to the github repo
  - Noticed none of the stats included wins and loses, so added a miscellaneous stats file to reference the number of a teams wins and loses. 
  - Made small adjustements to the datasets on a text editor (atom)
